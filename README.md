" Transform the way your team searches for top talent "

Short Snippet of why we built this:

A recruitment team averages over 23 hours reviewing resumes for a single job (and that's if there are active applicants!). Headhunter fees add significant cost, and and social and talent platforms are candidate-driven with no reliable screening mechanism. By the time you get to references, months have elapsed.

​

Meanwhile, referrals have proven to be 5x more effective than other sources of hiring, hiring process efficiency is increased by 55%, and 46% of referred hires stay at companies for 3 years or more.

​

Vouch takes the power of a referral and brings it to scale by tapping into the stream of candidates that HR teams see everyday. As a result, you can access an extensive network of pre-screened candidates referred in by fellow HR professionals.
